Association Rules Metrics

support = how popular an itemset is, as measured by the proportion of transactions in which an itemset appears.
confidence (A -> B) = support (A -> B)/support(A). It is the probability of seeing the consequent in a transaction given that it also contains antecedent. The confidence of 1 (maximal) for a rule A->B means that the consequent and antecedent always occur together.
lift (A -> B) = confidence (A -> B)/support(B). To measure how much more often the antecedent and consequent of a rule A->B occur together than we would expect if they were statistically independent. If A and B are independent, the lift score will be exactly 1.
leverage (A -> B = support (A -> B) - support(A) x support (B). The difference between the observed frequency of A and B appearing together and the frequency that would be expected if A and B were independent. Leverage value of 0 indicates independence.
conviction (A -> B) = (1-support(B))/(1-confidence(A -> B)). High conviction value means that the consequent is highly depending on the antecedent. If items are independent, the conviction is 1.
